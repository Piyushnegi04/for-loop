#for loop can  be used to iterate over a sequence (such as list, tuple or string) 
# x ="avi"
# for  i in x:
#     print(i)

x="avi"
for i in reversed(x):
    print(i)

# for   i in range(1, 11, 2):  ##1  is the start value and 11 is the end value. And 2 skip value
#     print(i)

# for   i in reversed(range(1, 11)):
#     print(i)

#list
# names = ["Avi", "John", "Jane"]
# for name in names:
#     if name == "Avi":
#         print("Hello Avi")
#         break
#     else:
